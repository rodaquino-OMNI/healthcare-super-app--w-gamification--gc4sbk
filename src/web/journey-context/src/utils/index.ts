/**
 * Journey Utilities
 * 
 * This file serves as the central export point for all journey utility functions,
 * providing a clean, organized API for importing journey-related utilities throughout
 * the application. This barrel file simplifies imports and ensures that all utility
 * functions are accessible from a single location, maintaining a consistent import
 * pattern across the codebase.
 *
 * By using explicit named exports, this file enables tree-shaking, allowing bundlers
 * to eliminate unused code and reduce bundle size in production builds.
