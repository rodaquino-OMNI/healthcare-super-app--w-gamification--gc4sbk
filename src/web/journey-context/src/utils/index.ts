/**
 * Journey Utilities
 * 
 * This file serves as the central export point for all journey utility functions,
 * providing a clean, organized API for importing journey-related utilities throughout
 * the application. These utilities handle journey path management, data conversion,
 * and validation across both web and mobile platforms.
 * 
 * By centralizing exports, this barrel file simplifies imports and ensures that
 * all utility functions are accessible from a single location, maintaining a
 * consistent import pattern across the codebase while enabling tree-shaking
 * through explicit named exports.
