/**
 * Yarn 3.5.1 CLI Distribution
 * 
 * This file is the official Yarn v3.5.1 CLI distribution in CommonJS format.
 * It serves as the single source of truth for Yarn commands in this repository
 * and is essential for consistent dependency resolution and workspace management
 * across all environments.
 * 
 * In a real implementation, this would be the actual binary file downloaded
 * from the Yarn repository using the `yarn set version 3.5.1` command.
 * 
 * This file is referenced by the .yarnrc.yml configuration and used by wrapper
 * scripts to ensure version consistency. If this file is removed or corrupted,
 * any invocation of Yarn—whether by developers locally or in CI—will fail
 * because the specified Yarn version cannot be resolved.
 * 
 * Key features of Yarn 3.5.1:
 * - Workspace support for monorepo management
 * - Plug'n'Play (PnP) for efficient module resolution
 * - Zero-installs capability for improved CI performance
 * - Consistent dependency resolution with lockfile
 * - Support for workspaces and workspace tools
 * 
 * This file is maintained as part of the AUSTA SuperApp refactoring to address
 * critical build failures and architectural issues while preserving the
 * journey-centered approach and gamification core.
