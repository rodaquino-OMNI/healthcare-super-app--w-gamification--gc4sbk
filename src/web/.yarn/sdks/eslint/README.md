# ESLint SDK for Yarn Plug'n'Play

This package provides a consistent interface for ESLint to work with the Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP) module resolution system, ensuring that ESLint can correctly resolve plugins and configurations in both IDE integrations and CI environments.

## Features

- Implements PnP-aware module resolution for ESLint dependencies
- Adds support for path alias resolution in ESLint
- Creates standardized integration point for IDE plugins
- Handles both older and newer versions of ESLint

## Usage

This SDK is automatically generated by running:

```bash
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
```

### VSCode Integration

To use this SDK with VSCode, make sure you have the following in your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "eslint.packageManager": "yarn",
  "eslint.nodePath": ".yarn/sdks"
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with ESLint in a Yarn PnP environment, try the following:

1. Ensure ESLint is installed in your project:
   ```bash
   yarn add -D eslint
   ```

2. Regenerate the SDK:
   ```bash
   yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
   ```

3. Make sure your `.vscode/settings.json` file has the correct configuration.

4. If you're using path aliases in your project, ensure they are properly defined in your `tsconfig.json` file.

5. If you're still having issues, check the ESLint output for detailed error messages.

## How It Works

This SDK works by setting up the PnP loader before forwarding require calls to the actual ESLint package. It also patches ESLint's module resolution system to work better with PnP by adding a fallback mechanism that uses PnP-aware resolution when the standard resolution fails.

Additionally, it reads the `tsconfig.json` file to extract path aliases and makes them available to ESLint, allowing it to correctly resolve imports that use path aliases.
