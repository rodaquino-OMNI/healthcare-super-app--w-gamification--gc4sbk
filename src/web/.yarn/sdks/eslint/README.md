# ESLint SDK for Yarn Plug'n'Play

This SDK provides a compatibility layer for ESLint in a Yarn Plug'n'Play environment. It ensures that ESLint can correctly locate and load its dependencies, plugins, configs, and parsers.

## Usage

This SDK is automatically generated by running:

```bash
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
```

It will be used by the ESLint extension in VSCode when you set the following in your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "eslint.nodePath": ".yarn/sdks"
}
```

## Features

- Resolves ESLint plugins, configs, and parsers in a Yarn PnP environment
- Supports path aliases in monorepo environments
- Provides a compatibility layer between Node.js require and Yarn PnP
- Handles workspace-specific resolution patterns

## How it works

The SDK wraps the ESLint API and injects the PnP loader before loading ESLint, ensuring all dependencies can be resolved correctly. It also provides a custom resolver that translates standard Node.js require calls to PnP-compatible resolution paths.
