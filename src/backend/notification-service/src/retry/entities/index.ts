 * Barrel file that exports all entities from the retry/entities directory
 * 
 * This file provides a clean, unified import interface for consumers of retry entities.
 * It simplifies imports throughout the application by allowing consumers to import
 * multiple entities from a single path, enforcing a consistent pattern for module exports,
 * and establishing a clear public API boundary for the retry module's entities.
