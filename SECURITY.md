# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the AUSTA SuperApp, please report it to security@austa.com.br. Our security team will respond as quickly as possible, typically within 24 hours.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigation or remediation steps (if known)

We are committed to working with security researchers and the community to address vulnerabilities promptly and transparently.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the AUSTA SuperApp receives security updates. Older versions are not supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < Latest| :x:                |

We recommend always updating to the latest version to ensure you have all security patches and improvements.

## Security Practices

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms:

- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications and web traffic
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Field-level Encryption**: Sensitive health and personal information receives additional encryption
- **Journey-specific Encryption**: Health metrics, insurance details, and telemedicine sessions have specialized encryption protocols

### Access Control

Access to sensitive resources is strictly controlled through multiple mechanisms:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with proper salt management
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for sensitive operations
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: For coarse-grained permissions
- **Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)**: For fine-grained, context-aware permissions
- **Journey-specific Roles**: Specialized roles for health, care, and plan journeys
- **Session Management**: Token-based stateless authentication with Redis-backed token blacklisting

### Security Headers

All web and API responses include security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces secure connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header

### Journey-Specific Security Considerations

Each journey in the AUSTA SuperApp has specialized security measures:

#### Health Journey
- **Health Data Privacy**: LGPD compliance with field-level encryption for health metrics
- **Device Integration Security**: Secure API communication with wearable devices
- **Health Goals Protection**: Access controls for personal health targets and progress

#### Care Journey
- **Telemedicine Security**: End-to-end encryption and session isolation for video consultations
- **Medication Data Protection**: Encrypted storage of medication information
- **Provider Directory Security**: Verified provider information with secure access controls

#### Plan Journey
- **Insurance Card Security**: Protection of sensitive member information
- **Claims Document Security**: Encrypted storage, access logging, and document watermarking
- **Benefit Information Protection**: Secure access controls for coverage and eligibility data

### Regular Security Audits

The AUSTA SuperApp undergoes comprehensive security assessments:

- **Quarterly Security Audits**: Conducted by independent security experts
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular testing of all application components
- **Code Security Reviews**: Automated and manual code reviews for security vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Verification**: Regular audits for LGPD and healthcare data regulations
- **Architecture Reviews**: Security assessment of system architecture changes

### Vulnerability Scanning

Automated vulnerability scanning is performed at multiple levels:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Regular scanning of running applications
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitoring for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of all container images
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Regular assessment of cloud infrastructure

### Incident Response

A comprehensive incident response plan is in place to handle security incidents effectively:

- **Incident Classification**: Structured approach to categorize and prioritize incidents
- **Response Team**: Dedicated security incident response team with defined roles
- **Communication Plan**: Clear protocols for internal and external communication
- **Containment Procedures**: Established processes to limit incident impact
- **Forensic Investigation**: Capabilities for thorough incident analysis
- **Recovery Procedures**: Defined steps for system restoration
- **Post-Incident Review**: Structured analysis to prevent future incidents

### Disaster Recovery

The AUSTA SuperApp implements a robust disaster recovery strategy:

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours for critical systems
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes maximum data loss
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with transaction logs
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Critical data replicated across regions
- **Regular Testing**: Quarterly disaster recovery drills

## Security Governance

The AUSTA SuperApp follows a structured security governance framework:

- **Security Policies**: Comprehensive documentation of security requirements and controls
- **Risk Assessment**: Regular evaluation of security risks and mitigation strategies
- **Compliance Management**: Monitoring and enforcement of regulatory requirements
- **Security Training**: Regular security awareness training for all team members
- **Vendor Security Assessment**: Evaluation of third-party security practices

## Continuous Improvement

We are committed to continuously improving our security posture through:

- **Security Metrics**: Tracking and analysis of security performance indicators
- **Threat Intelligence**: Monitoring of emerging threats and vulnerabilities
- **Industry Collaboration**: Participation in security communities and information sharing
- **Technology Updates**: Regular evaluation and implementation of security enhancements
